# Spot-It-Game

This game was made for a teacher of my high school. Its goal is to introduce beginner Chinese language learners to the different characters. The student has 30 seconds to identify as many matching characters from both sides. To make the game more challenging, the characters are rotated, dilated, and have different colors.

For fun, I added Russian and English to the game. Now, people can test their reaction skills with the familiar English language.
